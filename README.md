This project consists of two parts - a REST API & React application for the client side.

In order to run the REST API, you need to go to the server folder, and install the necessary dependencies, after which you can run ### npm run start in the terminal. This will start the server on Port http://localhost:3000.

To run the front-end part, just go to the client folder and install the necessary dependencies, after which you can just run ### npm run dev in the terminal. Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in your browser.
