This project consists of two parts - a REST API & React application for the client side.

In order to run the REST API, you need to go to the server, after installing the necessary dependencies and you can just run ### npm run start in the terminal. That will start the server on http://localhost:3000.

To run the front-end part as well, just go to the client folder and after installing the necessary dependencies, you can just run ### npm run dev in the terminal. Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in your browser.
